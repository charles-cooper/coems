# coems

This repository is the result of a discussion with a QA/test manager in Dusseldorf. The question was, why don't people have open mics for code? After all, there are open mics for music, poetry and other performing arts. What would it mean to have an open mic for code? So this repository is going to be a collection of "coems" - code poems. Perhaps some of them will be "coans" - koans. I will start out by solving some beginner coding problems, but to do so in a way which is aesthetically pleasing, down to whitespace and variable naming. Enjoy!
